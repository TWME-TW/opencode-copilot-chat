## Automated Updates

The `model-settings.json` file is regularly and automatically updated via GitHub Actions to fetch the latest models from OpenCode.

You can also run the update script locally using [Bun](https://bun.sh/):

```bash
bun install
bun install opencode-ai
bun run scripts/update-json.ts
```
